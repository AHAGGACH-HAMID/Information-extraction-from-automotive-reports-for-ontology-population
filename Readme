In this paper, we showcase our research on the use of ontologies and information extraction for the purpose of modeling damages incurred on car body. With the increasing use of technology in the automotive industry, it is important to have a standardized and efficient way of documenting and analyzing damage reports. In France, the majority of existing reports are unstructured and there is a lack of standardization in describing the damage. To address this issue, we have developed a domain ontology for car damage modeling ($OCD$) and we proposed an end-to-end system to extract information from automotive reports. The information extraction process involves using named entity recognition (NER) and relationship extraction (RE) techniques to identify and extract relevant information from the reports. The extracted information is then populated into the $OCD$ ontology, allowing for a structured and standardized representation of the damage information. The proposed system was tested on a real dataset of automotive reports and showed good results.
